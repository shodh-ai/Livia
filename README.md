#Livia: Efficient Small Language Models with Architectural Innovations

We are excited to introduce **Livia**, a suite of Small Language Models (SLMs) developed by **Shodh AI**. Built on the foundation of our research paper, *[Livia: Towards Efficient Small Language Models—Enhancing Performance with Architectural Innovations](link_to_paper)*, this suite represents a significant step forward in delivering high-performance natural language processing (NLP) capabilities with minimal computational demands.

Our models are a refined adaptation of the [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox) framework, integrating several cutting-edge architectural innovations. These improvements enable Livia to deliver robust NLP performance, while dramatically reducing computational overhead—making it an ideal solution for resource-constrained environments.

## Features

Our models leverage several architectural innovations:

- **Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)**: Improves the encoding of positional information, enhancing the model's ability to understand long-range dependencies.

- **Grouped Query Attention (GQA)**: Reduces the number of parameters in the attention mechanism without compromising expressiveness, leading to more efficient utilization of model capacity.

- **SwiGLU Activation Function**: Increases the non-linear modeling capability of the feed-forward networks, allowing the model to capture complex relationships within the data.

- **Compressed Root Mean Square Normalization (CRMSNorm)**: Contributes to training stability and efficiency by normalizing activations in a compressed space, reducing computational overhead.

- **Dual-Residual Transformer Architecture**: Facilitates better gradient propagation by combining pre-normalization and post-normalization, mitigating issues like vanishing gradients and representation collapse.

## Architecture

Our models are based on a Decoder-only Transformer architecture inspired by GPT-NeoX, with the above innovations integrated to optimize for efficiency and performance.
